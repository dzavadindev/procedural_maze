# Project Idea: Procedural Maze Generator

Generate random mazes of varying sizes using algorithms like Depth-First Search or Primâ€™s Algorithm and display them in the terminal or as an image.

### SMART Requirements:

1. The program must generate a maze of any user-specified size (e.g., 10x10, 50x50) within 2 seconds.
1. The maze must have a guaranteed solution path from start to finish, validated programmatically.
1. The project must include a feature to output the maze visually (ASCII in the terminal or as a basic image file).
